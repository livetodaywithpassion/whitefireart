Delusion dissolves and evenness (non-duality) remains – the natural state, simply this, nothing else. <br><br>Naturally remaining as naturalness (equanimity), is the natural (effortless) meditation of no one to meditate and nothing to meditate on – of no trying to get or trying to avoid, just effortless being which is always already so. <br><br>Recognise this again and again.”<br> <br>Bob Adamson</p>

There is no need to try to do something with the expectation that suddenly awareness will be there. <br><br>Presence-awareness is always here and now whether it is recognised or seemingly lost. It is not something that can be created or destroyed. <br><br>Conceptual thinking is like a cloud that seemingly blocks the sun. Being at ease in non-conceptual naturalness is presence-awareness, already here and now. <br><br>Re-cognise again, and again, and again, and despite what is appearing and disappearing, the knowing it is always so is constant. <br><br>Self-knowing, self-shining – just this, nothing else.”<br>Bob Adamson</p>

Imagining that ‘you’ exist as something or someone separate is the cause of acceptance or rejection of something known. It is illusion telling the story of its own deception. <br><br>The knower and the known are just concepts seemingly dividing natural non-conceptual knowing.

The value of any insight, understanding, or realisation can only be in the ever-fresh presence of the moment.<br><br> Yesterday’s realisation is not a bit of good – it is dead, it has lost its vitality.  It is useless to try and cling to or hold onto an insight, understanding, or realisation, for only in its movement can ever-fresh and new insights of truth or reality appear.  <br><br>The idea of enlightenment or self-realisation as a onetime event or a lasting and permanent state or experience is an erroneous concept. Understand-ING or know-ING is alive in the immediacy which can never be negated. The emphasis is on the activity of know-ING which is going on as the immediacy now – not the dead concept I understand or I know.” <br>           <br>Bob Adamson</p>

Emptiness can never be emptied of emptiness, nor can it be filled by emptiness. <br><br>With that concept cancelled out, only the wordless, thoughtless, indescribable emptiness remains. <br><br>Not a vacuum or a void, but a vivid self-shining, self-knowing, self-aware emptiness, like a clear sky full of light. <br><br>See for yourself – no one can do it for you.  Immediate simplicity – continue to see that the seeing is continuous. <br><br>Any doubt, question, or argument, and the conceptual seeker seemingly appears again. <br><br>Yet in that seeing, non-conceptual emptiness remains undisturbed.”<br><br>Bob Adamson</p>
